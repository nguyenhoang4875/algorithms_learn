        suppress constant factors and lower-order terms
    Four Examples

2.2 Big-O Notation
    Big-O Notation (English Version)
    T (n) = O(f (n)) if and only if T (n) is eventually bounded above by a constant multiple of f (n).

        Big-O Notation (Mathematical Version)
        T (n) = O(f (n)) if and only if there exist positive constants c and n0 such that  T (n) <= c Â· f (n)  for all n >= n0
    Two Basic Examples
    Degree-k Polynomials are O(n^k )
    Degree-k Polynomials Are Not O(n^(k-1))
